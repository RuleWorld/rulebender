# RuleBender and RuleBased Modeling #
Rule-based modeling (RBM) is a powerful and increasingly popular approach to modeling intracellular biochemistry. Current interfaces for RBM are predominantly text-based and command-line driven. Better visual tools are needed to make RBM accessible to a broad range of users, to make specification of models less error prone, and to improve workflows. We present `RuleBender`, an open-source visual interface that facilitates interactive debugging, simulation, and analysis of RBMs.
